# 👋 Hey there! I'm Paul Racisz

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a growing love for Linux desktops (currently deep-diving into **Hyprland** on **Arch Linux** 🧠🐧), and a knack for building sleek, intuitive mobile and web experiences.

### 📖 Currently Building
I'm working on a **React Native Bible Reader App** focused on simplicity, clean UI/UX, and offline-first usability. It's a project straight from the heart, blending my love for faith and technology.

### 🛠️ What I Do
For the past **4** years, I've been a Software Developer at [Firefly Integrations](https://www.fireflyint.com/) in Middlebury, Indiana. I develop and maintain a robust mobile app that integrates with high-end luxury RV systems; think batteries, solar, tanks, HVAC, RGBs, lights, inverters, and more.

I specialize in:
- ⚛️ **React.js** / React Native
- 🔷 **Vue.js**
- 🅰️ **AngularJS**
- 💡 Custom UIs, real-time data integration, embedded systems, and hardware interfacing

### 🧰 On My Workbench
Lately, I’ve been diving into:
- 🖥️ Helping friends **build their own gaming PCs**
- 🎮 Exploring PC optimization and system cooling
- 💻 Linux-based setups for privacy, performance, and aesthetics
- 🛠️ Tiling window managers & dotfile ricing (Hyprland is *chef's kiss*)

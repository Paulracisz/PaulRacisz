# 👋 Hey there! I'm Paul Racisz

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a growing love for Linux desktops (currently deep-diving into **Hyprland** on **Arch Linux** 🧠🐧), and a knack for building sleek, intuitive mobile and web experiences.

### 📖 Currently Building
I'm working on a **React Native Bible Reader App** focused on simplicity, clean UI/UX, and offline-first usability. It's a project straight from the heart, blending my love for faith and technology.

### 🛠️ What I Do
For the past **4** years, I've been a Software Developer at [Firefly Integrations](https://www.fireflyint.com/) in Middlebury, Indiana. I develop and maintain a robust mobile app that integrates with high-end luxury RV systems; think batteries, solar, tanks, HVAC, RGBs, lights, inverters, and more.

### 🧰 On My Workbench
Lately, I’ve been diving into:

- 💻 Having fun with tiling window managers & customizing Linux-based setups with dotfiles for privacy, performance, and aesthetics.
- 🇪🇸 Estoy aprendido español con Duolingo. (I'm learning Spanish to help stay connected with my community!)
